## Jena has the following available reasoners: #reasoning
- Transitive reasoner: Provides support for storing and traversing class and property lattices. This implements just the transitive and reflexive properties of rdfs:subPropertyOf and rdfs:subClassOf.
- RDFS rule reasoner: Implements a configurable subset of the RDFS entailments.
- OWL, OWL Mini, OWL Micro Reasoners: A set of useful but incomplete implementation of the OWL/Lite subset of the OWL/Full language.
- Generic rule reasoner: A rule based reasoner that supports user defined rules. Forward chaining, tabled backward chaining and hybrid execution strategies are supported.
## TODO Hoe gaan we gebruik maken van reasoning? #reasoning Dit is een uiting van de balans tussen kennismodel en applicatie.
