## Voordelen van RDF boven relationele tabellen.
- The main advantage of RDF is its flexibility. If someone needs to add a new type of data about some thing, it can be described using triples. In a relational database, youâ€™d need to add a new column and update the schema.
- The second advantage of RDF is that all IDs are URLs. That guarantees uniqueness, so merging two datasets becomes a trivial task - the IDs will not collide. Besides, URLs give the advantage of working as locators as well as identifiers. Being a locator means that a URL helps to show where you need to look if you need more information about something. This is the beauty of linked data.
